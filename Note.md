**Data Science Task Categories**
 - Data Management -- storage, management and retrieval of data
 - Data Integration and Transformation -- streamline data pipeline and automate data processing tasks
 - Data Visualization -- provide graphical representation of data and assist with communicational insights.
 - Model Building -- enable Building, Deployment, Monitoring and Assessment of Data and Machine Learning models.
 - Model Deployment
 - Model Monitoring and Assessment
 
***Python in Data science***
**NumPy**
 - Is a python library designed for AI.
**Natural Language Processing**
 - Python library that is used for Natural Language Processing.

***Machine Learning***
 - It uses algorithms, aka. models to identify patterns in the data.
 - The process by which the model learns data patterns is called "model training".
 - Types of ML are Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement.
  > Supervised learning model identifies the relationship between input data and correct output. 
  > Unsupervised learning model doesn't use external help. Model itself labels data and analyzes patterns. Ex: Clustering model divides each record into specific categories.
  > Reinforcement learns patterns similar to human learning. Ex: AI driven chess bots, robot learning how to walk, etc. 
 - Supervised learning comprises two types of models, regression and classification.
 - Deep learning refers to a general set of models and techniques that loosely emulate the human brain to identify and solve given problems.
 - **Model Asset eXchange** -- is open source repository for ready to use data and customizable deep learning microservices. Those model-serving microservices are built and distributed on GitHub as open source Docker images.
 - **Red Hat OpenShift is a Kubernetes platform to automate deployment, scaling and management of microservices. MAX microservices can be used in there.
 - **Ml-exchange.org** has multiple predefined models.
